But when the earth took on its golden raiment and became well adorned and the owners believed that they had full control over their lands Our command came upon them by night or by day, and We convened it into a stubble, as though it had not blossomed yesterday. Thus do We expound the signs for a people who reflect."

He provides livelihood for you through the cattle that He made for you, from their meat and milk. Nothing of His creation resembles Him. He is the One Who hears the statements of His servants, and the One Who sees their actions. Nothing of that escapes Him and He will recompense them for their actions: if good then with good, and if evil then with bad."
