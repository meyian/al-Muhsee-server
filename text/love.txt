These desirable things include women, children, wealth (in the form of gold and silver) that is overflowing and piled up, beautiful trained horses, livestock (such as camels, cows and sheep), as well as farmlands – all of which is the enjoyment of the life of the world which lasts only for a short while. A believer should not become attached to these things as Allah has kept the best place of return for him: the Paradise that is as wide as the heavens and the earth."

    "translation": "(O Messenger!) If you are among the believers and rise (in the state of war) to lead the Prayer for them, let a party of them stand with you to worship, keeping their arms. When they have performed their prostration, let them go behind you, and let another party who have not prayed, pray with you, remaining on guard and keeping their arms, for the unbelievers <em>love</em> to see you heedless of your arms and your baggage so that they might swoop upon you in a surprise attack. But there shall be no blame upon you if you were to lay aside your arms if you are either troubled by rain or are sick; but remain on guard. Surely Allah has prepared a humiliating chastisement for the unbelievers."

    "translation": "You, husbands, will not be able to be completely fair to your wives with respect to your affection, even if you tried to do so. This is due to circumstances and factors beyond your control. So do not incline fully away from the one you do not <em>love</em> and leave her like a woman suspended, who does not have a husband to fulfill her right and nor is she unmarried so that she may seek to marry another. If you set things right between yourselves, by giving the wife her due right and being mindful of Allah in that regard, then Allah will be Forgiving and Merciful towards you."

    "translation": "The believers, men and women, are helpers to one another, because of the faith that unites them. They command good – which is everything <em>loved</em> by Allah, represented by the various forms of obedience, such as accepting His Oneness and the ritual prayer – and they prohibit evil – which is everything hated by Allah, and includes sins such as disbelief and dealing in usury in financial transactions. They perform the ritual prayer in a complete manner, and they obey Allah and His Messenger. People with these praiseworthy qualities will receive Allah’s mercy. Allah is Mighty and nothing can overcome Him. He is Wise in His creating, handling of matters and establishment of laws."

    "translation": "O mankind! if ye are in doubt concerning the Resurrection, then lo! We have created you from dust, then from a drop of seed, then from a clot, then from a little lump of flesh shapely and shapeless, that We may make (it) clear for you. And We cause what We will to remain in the wombs for an appointed time, and afterward We bring you forth as infants, then (give you growth) that ye attain your full strength. And among you there is he who dieth (young), and among you there is he who is brought back to the most abject time of life, so that, after knowledge, he knoweth naught. And thou (Muhammad) seest the earth barren, but when We send down water thereon, it doth thrill and swell and put forth every <em>lovely</em> kind (of growth)."

    "translation": "And those of you who cannot afford to marry free, believing women (muhsanat), then marry such believing women whom your right hands possess. Allah knows all about your faith. All of you belong to one another. Marry them, then, with the leave of their guardians, and give them their bridal-due in a fair manner that they may live in the protection of wedlock rather than be either mere objects of unfettered lust or given to secret <em>love</em> affairs. Then if they become guilty of immoral conduct after they have entered into wedlock, they shall be liable to half the penalty to which free women (muhsanat) are liable. This relaxation is for those of you who fear to fall into sin by remaining unmarried. But if you persevere, it is better for you. Allah is All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate."

    "verse_key": "2:194",
    "translation": "The sacred month in which Allah allowed you to enter the Sacred Mosque and perform Umrah in the seventh year after the Migration is a compensation for the sacred month when you were stopped by the idolaters from entering the Sacred Mosque in the sixth year after the Migration. The law of equality applies when the limits are overstepped in regards to sacred things, such as the sacred land, the sacred month and being in an ordered state of purity (iḥrām) for pilgrimage to the Sacred Mosque. When someone wrongs you in any of these, treat them as they treated you, but do not go beyond what they have done: Allah does not <em>love</em> those who overstep His limits. Be mindful of Allah by not going beyond what He has given you permission to do. Know that Allah is with those who are mindful of Him, giving them success and supporting them."

    "translation": "Hold tightly, O you who have faith, to the Book and the traditions of the Prophet, and do not do that which will bring division amongst you. Remember the blessings of Allah upon you when you were enemies before Islam, fighting each other for the slightest reason, and He brought your hearts together through Islam, so that you became brothers in your faith through His grace, showing each other <em>love</em> and respect and listening to each other’s advice. Before that you were on the brink of entering the fire of Hell because of your disbelief. Allah saved you from the fire of Hell through Islam and guided you to faith. In the way that Allah has made this clear to you, He also makes clear to you what will put things right for you in this world and the Afterlife, so that you are guided to the right way of life."

    "translation": "After Allah mentioned the migrants and praised them, He mentions the Helpers and praises them also, saying may He be glorified: And those Helpers who inhabited Al-Madīnah before the Migrants and chose to bring faith in Allah and His Messenger, they <em>love</em> those who migrated to them from Makkah and do not feel any anger or jealousy towards those who migrated in the path of Allah when they are given any of the Fay’ whilst not being given anything themselves. They give priority to the Migrants over themselves in worldly shares, even though they themselves are needy and poor. Whoever Allah saves from the greed of his own self for wealth, and he spends it in His path, they are the ones who are successful by achieving whatever they hope for and gaining salvation from whatever they fear."

    "translation": "God saw you, O Prophet, turning your face and gazing towards the heavens, anticipating revelation about changing the direction of prayer to the place you <em>loved</em>. God will turn you to a prayer direction which you will be pleased with, to the Sacred House of God, instead of the prayer direction you now face, so turn your face to the Sacred House of God in Makkah, and wherever you are, O believers, turn towards it to perform your prayers. Those who have been given the Scripture, the Jews and the Christians, know well that the change of prayer direction is the truth revealed from their Creator Who arranges and manages their lives, as it is clear in their Scripture. God is not unaware of what those who turn away from the truth do. He, glory be to Him, is aware of everything, and will reward them according to their actions."

    "translation": "Allah, may He be glorified, is the One Who created gardens raised above the ground by means of stems and trellises, and spread out gardens on the surface of the earth without any stems, He is the One Who created the date palm. He produced crops which differ in their shape and taste. He is the One Who created the olive and the pomegranate, the leaves of which are similar but their fruit is different. Eat, O people, from its fruit when it bears fruit and pay its Zakat on the day of its harvest. Do not overstep the limits of the sacred law with respect to eating and spending, because Allah does not <em>love</em> those who overstep His limits in this and other respects. Rather, He hates such people. The One Who created all of this is the One Who has made it lawful for His servants. Therefore, the idolaters have no right to declare it unlawful."

    "translation": "There is no sin upon the blind who has lost his eyesight, nor upon the lame nor the sick if they leave those responsibilities they can no longer fulfil, i.e. jihad in the way of Allah. O believers! There is no sin upon you in eating from your own homes or the homes of sons, nor in eating from the homes of your fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, paternal uncles and aunts nor maternal uncles and aunts, nor those houses which you have been entrusted with safeguarding, i.e. garden-keeper. There is also no sin in eating at the house of your friend as is customary to please him. It is not a problem whether you eat alone or together in groups. So when you do enter any houses like the ones mentioned above or any others, greet those within them with peace by saying: “Peace be upon you”, and if there is no one inside them, then greet yourselves by saying: “Peace be upon us and the pious servants of Allah”. This is a blessed greeting from Allah; He has legislated it for you because of the <em>love</em> and affection it spreads among you. It is also a pleasant greeting in that it pleases the soul of the one who hears is Just like the aforementioned clarity in this Sūrah, Allah clearly explains His verses in the hope that you will implement whatever they contain."
